        <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>In summer 2024, I was contracted to transfer employee files to a new HR system. Given my history with the company, I was entrusted with handling sensitive information.</p>
        <p>I developed bash scripts to automate file management, significantly reducing the time required for the transfer.</p>
        <p>Afterward, I created standard operating procedures for accessing and managing files in the new system and implemented security measures to protect the data.</p>

        <p>I managed the hiring process for 13x 1-800-GOT-JUNK? franchises, ensuring a consistent and effective recruitment experience.</p>
